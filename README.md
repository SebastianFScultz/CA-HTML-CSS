The screen changes to a desktop version at a width of 1512px.

I changed the background color to black when the width is 1512px because it looked very empty and boring with a white background.

Didn't manage to make the website responsive across different screen sizes when stretched it out. Only made it look good for Iphone SE and Mac Book Pro 14
